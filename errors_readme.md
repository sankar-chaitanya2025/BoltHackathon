## MeetSpace Project Errors Log

### Environment Variables Missing
```
Error: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is not defined
Error: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is not defined
```

These errors occur because the Supabase connection hasn't been set up yet. To resolve:
1. Click the "Connect to Supabase" button in the top right
2. Complete the Supabase project setup
3. The environment variables will be automatically added to the project

### AI Service Setup
The project uses Ollama for AI features. To set up:
1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
2. Pull the Mistral model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull mistral
   ```
3. Start the Ollama server:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

The AI features will automatically use the local Ollama server running on port 11434. If the server is not available, the application will fall back to mock suggestions.

### Resolution Steps

1. Set up Supabase:
   - Click "Connect to Supabase" button
   - Follow the setup wizard
   - Environment variables will be auto-configured

2. Set up Ollama:
   - Install Ollama
   - Pull the Mistral model
   - Start the server

Once these steps are completed, the application should start without errors.
